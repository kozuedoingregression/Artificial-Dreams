# Linear Regression With Time Series
> Use two features unique to time series: lags and time steps

- Forecasting is perhaps the most common application of machine learning in the real world. Businesses forecast product demand, governments forecast economic and population growth, meteorologists forecast the weather. The understanding of things to come is a pressing need across science, government, and industry (not to mention our personal lives!), and practitioners in these fields are increasingly applying machine learning to address this need.

- Time series forecasting is a broad field with a long history. This course focuses on the application of modern machine learning methods to time series data with the goal of producing the most accurate predictions. The lessons in this course were inspired by winning solutions from past Kaggle forecasting competitions but will be applicable whenever accurate forecasts are a priority.
