# Time Series Analysis: Notes and Code
> Applied machine learning to real-world forecasting tasks.
> 
This repository contains notes and Python code for understanding and implementing various time series analysis techniques, including linear regression with time series, seasonality, trend, using time series as features, hybrid models, and forecasting with machine learning. The goal is to explore different methods of analyzing and predicting time series data, with a focus on machine learning-based approaches.

## Contents

- **Linear Regression with Time Series**  
  Introduction to using linear regression for time series data, handling autocorrelation, and interpreting the results.

- **Seasonality**  
  A detailed exploration of seasonal patterns in time series data, how to detect them, and techniques for modeling them.

- **Trend**  
  Identifying and modeling trends in time series data, and understanding the implications of trend components.

- **Time Series as Features**  
  Using time series data as input features for machine learning models, such as regression or classification tasks.

- **Hybrid Models**  
  Combining statistical and machine learning models to improve forecasting accuracy, e.g., integrating ARIMA with neural networks.

- **Forecasting with Machine Learning**  
  Implementing various machine learning models for time series forecasting, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the code:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `statsmodels`
- `xgboost`
- `keras` (for LSTM models)
- `seaborn`

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:
