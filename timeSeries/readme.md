This repository contains notes and Python code for understanding and implementing various time series analysis techniques, including linear regression with time series, seasonality, trend, using time series as features, hybrid models, and forecasting with machine learning. The goal is to explore different methods of analyzing and predicting time series data, with a focus on machine learning-based approaches.

## Key Topics
1. Linear Regression with Time Series

Linear regression is one of the simplest ways to model time series data, but it requires careful treatment of autocorrelation. We'll explore:

    Basic linear regression on time series data.
    Handling temporal dependencies.
    Dealing with stationarity and transforming the data.

2. Seasonality in Time Series

Seasonality refers to repeating patterns or cycles in data. In this section, we'll:

    Detect seasonality in time series data.
    Use techniques like Fourier transforms or seasonal decomposition to model seasonality.

3. Trend in Time Series

Time series often have trends, where data values increase or decrease over time. Here, we'll:

    Identify and model linear or non-linear trends.
    Use differencing and other techniques to make the series stationary.

4. Time Series as Features in Machine Learning Models

Time series can be used as features in various machine learning models. This section covers:

    Lag features, rolling window statistics, and Fourier transforms as features.
    How to preprocess and prepare time series data for machine learning.

5. Hybrid Models

Hybrid models combine classical time series models like ARIMA with machine learning techniques. We'll explore:

    How to combine ARIMA for trend and seasonality with machine learning models for residual forecasting.
    Integrating statistical models and machine learning for better performance.

6. Forecasting with Machine Learning

Machine learning methods, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), can be powerful for forecasting. In this section, we cover:

    Implementing machine learning models for forecasting.
    Evaluating model performance using error metrics like RMSE and MAE.
