there's no distance between us, i've never been this close to a person before. There's no boundry between us, i used to be terrified of that. I was so scared of this. you know, i had no idea that i could feel so many different emotions. i don't think either of us knew how scary or nerve-wracking being yourself around others could be. but you made me realized all of it. What can I do for you? How can i make you smile? you're so much stronger that i think you are, and you're so much weaker that i feel you are. you're delicate, you're fragile. that's why wherever you go, bright, sunny days follow after. For years, the only person I knew this well was myself. I never knew a world like this existed. Thankyou for shattering my reality. Thankyou for wanting a future with me. how can i repay you for what you've done?
