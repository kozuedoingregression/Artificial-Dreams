## What is Serial Dependence?

In earlier lessons, we investigated properties of time series that were most easily modeled as time dependent properties, that is, with features we could derive directly from the time index. Some time series properties, however, can only be modeled as serially dependent properties, that is, using as features past values of the target series. The structure of these time series may not be apparent from a plot over time; plotted against past values, however, the structure becomes clear -- as we see in the figure below below.
